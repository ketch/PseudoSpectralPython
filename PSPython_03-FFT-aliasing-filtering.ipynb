    "As we have seen, aliasing means that wavenumbers of magnitude greater than $\\pi m/L$ are incorrectly represented as lower wavenumbers on a grid with $m$ points.  This suggests that we shouldn't allow larger wavenumbers in our numerical solution.  For linear problems, this simply means that we should represent the initial condition by a truncated Fourier series containing modes with wavenumbers less than $\\pi m/L$.  This happens naturally when we sample the function at the grid points.  As we evolve in time, higher frequencies are not generated due to the linearity of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear problems are a different story.  Let's consider what happens when we have a quadratic term like $u^2$, as in Burgers' equation.  In general, if the grid function $u$ contains wavenumbers up to $\\pi m/L$, then $u^2$ contains frequencies up to $2 \\pi m/L$.  So each time we compute this term, we generate high frequencies that get aliased back to lower frequencies on our grid.  Clearly this has nothing to do with the correct mathematical solution and will lead to errors.  Even worse, this aliasing effect can, as it is repeated at every step, lead to an instability that causes the numerical solution to blow up."

    "By taking $m=128$, we cut by half the wavenumbers that can be represented on the grid.  As you can see from the plots, this means that some of the wavenumbers present in the initial data are in the upper half of the representable range (i.e., outside the dashed red lines).  That means that the highest wavenumbers generated by the quadratic term will be aliased -- and they will be aliased back into that upper-half range.  This leads to a gradual accumulation of high-wavenumber modes, easily visible in both plots.  Eventually the high-wavenumber modes dominate the numerical solution and lead to blowup.\n",

    "## Filtering\n",

    "How can we avoid aliasing instability?  The proper approach is to ensure that the solution is well resolved, so that the instability never appears.  However, this may entail a very substantial computational cost.  One way to ensure stability even if the solution is underresolved is by *filtering*, which is also known as *dealiasing*.  In general it is unwise to rely on filtering, since it can mask the fact that the solution is not resolved (and hence not accurate).  But understanding filtering can give a bit more insight into aliasing instability itself."
