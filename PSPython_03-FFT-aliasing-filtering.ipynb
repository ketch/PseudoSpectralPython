    "As we have seen, aliasing means that wavenumbers of magnitude greater than $\\pi m/L$ are incorrectly represented as lower wavenumbers on a grid with $m$ points.  This suggests that we shouldn't allow larger wavenumbers in our numerical solution.  For linear problems, this simply means that we should represent the initial condition by a truncated Fourier series containing modes with wavenumbers less than $\\pi m/L$.  This happens naturally when we sample the function at the grid points.  As we evolve in time, higher frequencies are not generated due to the linearity of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear problems are a different story.  Let's consider what happens when we have a quadratic term like $u^2$, as in Burgers' equation.  In general, if the grid function $u$ contains wavenumbers up to $\\pi m/L$, then $u^2$ contains frequencies up to $2 \\pi m/L$.  So each time we compute this term, we generate high frequencies that get aliased back to lower frequencies on our grid.  Clearly this has nothing to do with the correct mathematical solution and will lead to errors.  Even worse, this aliasing effect can, as it is repeated at every step, lead to an instability that causes the numerical solution to blow up."

That means that the highest wavenumbers generated by the quadratic term will be aliased -- and they will be aliased back into that upper-half range.
